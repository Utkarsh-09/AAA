I wanted to share my journey within the asia innovation hub team. It has been a truly transformative experience, filled with personal growth and valuable lessons. First and foremost I am very grateful for the training that I received during the initial months with the company. It provided me with a good start and relevant knowledge and skills needed to work for a team.

Working in the innovation hub has been both exciting and challenging. The technology we work with is constantly evolving, requiring us to stay adaptable and constantly come up with fresh ideas that is expected from every member of the team to bring in new ideas from time 
to time. There is also very active collaboration needed for which I am expected every day in office and most of our discussions happen in person which is really necessary and useful for kind of work they do as there isn't any particular workflow defined
and new chances for a project and poc can arrive at any time.
Collaboration plays a vital role in our work, and being able to have face-to-face discussions in the office has been incredibly beneficial.

From working on end-to-end projects , buiding UI , attending sessions on blockchain and quantum computing to collaborating 
with IIT Indore believe me I've seen it all in the past year.
Majority of my work recently shifted onto exploring the potential of generative AI, discovering its practical applications and how we can leverage it for our business.

Looking back on this journey, I am amazed at the growth I've experienced and the invaluable experiences I've gained. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities for innovation, and I am excited to continue this journey with the Asia Innovation Hub team.
