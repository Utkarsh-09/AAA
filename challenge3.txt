//Trying to create the best possible prompt as per the use case
//Prompt: I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. 
The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: 
1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, 
but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 
2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. 
a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you),
b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), and 
c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). 
3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt 
section until it's complete.

//OpenAI: Great! I'm happy to help you with this. What would you like the prompt to be about?

//Prompt: I want you add comments for a VBA code that I sent you such that it summarizes each function and class in detail
 and also all the other relevant details is also added as comments only to that code.

//OpenAI: Thanks for providing your prompt idea. Based on your input, here are three sections for your prompt:
Revised Prompt:
Write comments for a VBA code that summarizes each function and class in detail. Additionally, include all other relevant details as comments in the code.
Suggestions:
Start by thoroughly analyzing the VBA code and its purpose. This will help you understand the code's structure and what each function and class does.
Write comments for each function and class that explain what it does, what inputs it expects, what it returns, and any limitations or constraints it may have.
Use clear, concise language and avoid technical jargon whenever possible. Remember that your comments should be easy to understand for someone who is not familiar with the code.
Comment on any other relevant details, such as how the code interacts with other systems or any external dependencies it may have.
Questions:
Can you provide some additional context about the VBA code? What is its purpose, and how will it be used?
Are there any specific requirements or constraints that the comments should adhere to, such as a specific format or length?
Is there anything else you would like me to keep in mind while writing the comments?

//Prompt: Include all the suggestions in the prompt and I have no further questions

//ChatGPT: Sure thing, here's your revised prompt with all the suggestions included:
Revised Prompt:
Write comments for a VBA code that summarizes each function and class in detail.
Additionally, include all other relevant details as comments in the code.
Suggestions:
1.Start by thoroughly analyzing the VBA code and its purpose. This will help you understand the code's structure and what each function and class does.
2.Write comments for each function and class that explain what it does, what inputs it expects, what it returns, and any limitations or constraints it may have. Use clear, concise language and avoid technical jargon whenever possible. Remember that your comments should be easy to understand for someone who is not familiar with the code.
3.Include any relevant details about how the code interacts with other systems or any external dependencies it may have.
4.Be sure to comment any important decision points in the code, and explain why a certain approach was taken over others.
5.If any complex algorithms are present in the code, provide additional comments for those sections to make them more understandable.
6.Use a consistent and clear format for your comments throughout the code to make it easier for someone to navigate and understand.

//Now using the revised prompt in a new chat window since I had no further questions for a new prompt that I got in a new chat window.

//Code Explanation:When initial code is uploaded to OpenAI
This is a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code that is used to connect to an Oracle database and display data from the "emp" table.
 It also allows the user to navigate through the records, add new records, and commit changes to the database.

The code initializes a session object, a database object, and a Dynaset object to connect to the Oracle database. 
The Form_Load() event is used to establish a connection to the database, create a Dynaset object with a SQL statement, and call the EmpRefresh() subroutine.

The EmpRefresh() subroutine retrieves the data from the current record of the Dynaset object and displays it in the appropriate text boxes on the form. 
If the record is at the beginning or end of the Dynaset, the text boxes are cleared.

The cmdFirst_Click(), cmdLast_Click(), cmdPrevious_Click(), and cmdNext_Click() events are used to navigate through the records of the Dynaset object. 
The AddNew_Click() event is used to clear the text boxes and allow the user to add a new record to the database. The Commit_Click() event is used to save the changes to the database.

The DoValidationChecks() function is used to validate the data entered by the user before it is added to the database.
 If the validation fails, an error message is displayed. The UpdateDynasetFields() function is used to update the fields of the Dynaset object with the data entered by the user.

Overall, this code provides a basic user interface to interact with an Oracle database, display data, and modify it.
 However, it is important to note that this code is specific to VBA and may need to be modified to work with other programming languages or environments.
 Additionally, it is recommended to use best practices for database connectivity and data validation to ensure data integrity and security.
