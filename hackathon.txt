To get the best possible solutions for our problem statements we used prompt engineering.
Before we dive into the details of prompt engineering, let's first define what prompts are. 
In the context of language models(example gpt3), a prompt is a piece of text that is used to generate new text.
So we can actually say the better the prompt the better the solution because 
one significant drawback of the LLMs is their inability to reason beyond the information provided in the prompt
making it necessary to use prompt engineering strategies to achieve the desired output.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts to improve the quality of the output generated by the language model.

So after brainstorming about this during the hackathon we thought why not leverage these language models 
to create the best possible prompt for itself which can then we used to generate the solution.
