Google Apps Script is a scripting language developed by Google to automate tasks within Google Suite, which includes applications such as Google Sheets, Google Docs, and Google Forms. It allows users to create custom functions, automate workflows, and integrate with external APIs, all within the Google Suite environment.

Apps Script is used to automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks, such as sending emails, generating reports, and processing data. It enables users to create custom functions that can be used to manipulate data, automate workflows, and extend the functionality of Google Suite applications.

Here are some useful use cases for Google Apps Script:

Automating Data Entry: Apps Script can automate the process of data entry by importing data from external sources, formatting it, and inserting it into Google Sheets or Google Forms.

Generating Reports: Apps Script can be used to create custom reports based on data in Google Sheets, Docs or Forms, and automate the process of generating and sharing them.

Customizing Google Forms: Apps Script can be used to create custom forms, add custom functionality, and automate the process of processing and analyzing responses.

Sending Automated Emails: Apps Script can automate the process of sending emails based on triggers such as form submissions, data changes, or scheduled intervals.

Integrating with External APIs: Apps Script can be used to integrate with external APIs to extend the functionality of Google Suite applications and automate tasks such as data processing and analysis.

Overall, Google Apps Script is a powerful tool for automating tasks within Google Suite, improving efficiency and productivity, and extending the functionality of Google Suite applications.

To automate data entry in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script, you can use the following steps:

Open the Google Sheet where you want to automate data entry.
Go to the "Tools" menu and select "Script editor" to open the Apps Script editor.
In the editor, create a new function that retrieves the data you want to enter. For example, you can retrieve data from a form submission or an external source using an API.
Write a function to format the data and insert it into the appropriate cells in the sheet.
Set up a trigger to automatically run the function when data is added to the sheet or at regular intervals.
Here is an example of code that retrieves data from a Google Form and enters it into a specific sheet:

kotlin
Copy code
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Sheet1");
  var row = e.range.getRow();
  var data = e.values;
  sheet.getRange(row, 1, 1, data.length).setValues([data]);
}
In this example, the "onFormSubmit" function is triggered when a form is submitted. It retrieves the data from the form submission and enters it into the first row of "Sheet1" in the Google Sheet.

You can customize the code to retrieve data from different sources and enter it into different locations in the sheet. With some coding knowledge, you can also create more complex functions that manipulate data, perform calculations, and interact with external APIs.

Here's a more comprehensive list of sources that you can retrieve data from in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script:

Google Forms - retrieve data from form submissions using the onFormSubmit trigger.

External APIs - retrieve data from external APIs using the UrlFetchApp class.

Google Sheets - retrieve data from other sheets within the same Google Drive account using the SpreadsheetApp class.

Google Drive - retrieve data from files stored in Google Drive, including text files, CSV files, and Google Docs using the DriveApp class.

Google Calendar - retrieve data from Google Calendar, including events, reminders, and calendars using the CalendarApp class.

Google Analytics - retrieve data from Google Analytics using the Analytics service in Apps Script.

Google Cloud Storage - retrieve data from Google Cloud Storage using the CloudStorage service in Apps Script.

Google BigQuery - retrieve data from Google BigQuery using the BigQuery service in Apps Script.

Google Maps - retrieve data from Google Maps using the Maps service in Apps Script.

Twitter - retrieve data from Twitter using the Twitter service in Apps Script.

These are just a few examples of the sources that you can retrieve data from in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script. There are many other APIs and services that you can use with Apps Script to retrieve and manipulate data.

Here are some additional sources that you can retrieve data from in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script:

These are just a few more examples of the sources that you can retrieve data from in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script. With some coding knowledge, you can connect to many other APIs and services to retrieve and manipulate data in Google Sheets.

Sure! Here's an example of how you can use Google Apps Script to receive data from a Google Form, store it in a Google Sheet, and send an email notification for every new form submission:

Create a Google Form
First, create a Google Form and add the questions you want to ask. For this example, let's say you have a form that collects the name, email address, and message of people who want to contact you.

Create a Google Sheet
Next, create a Google Sheet where you want to store the responses from the form. In the sheet, create a header row with the column names for each form question (e.g. "Name", "Email", "Message").

Write the code
Open the script editor in the Google Sheet where you want to store the form responses. Go to Tools > Script Editor. This will open a new tab with the script editor.

In the script editor, write the following code:

css
Copy code
function onSubmit(e) {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var row = sheet.getLastRow();
  var name = e.values[1];
  var email = e.values[2];
  var message = e.values[3];
  sheet.getRange(row, 1).setValue(name);
  sheet.getRange(row, 2).setValue(email);
  sheet.getRange(row, 3).setValue(message);
  var subject = "New form submission";
  var body = "A new form submission has been received.";
  MailApp.sendEmail("your.email@example.com", subject, body);
}
This code creates a function called onSubmit, which is triggered when someone submits the form. The function retrieves the response data from the form submission event object, writes it to the last row of the Google Sheet, and sends an email notification to the specified email address.

Save and authorize the script
Save the script and authorize it to run by going to Run > Enable the trigger. This will create a trigger that will run the onSubmit function every time a new form submission is received.

Test the form
Test the form by submitting a new response. You should see a new row added to the Google Sheet, and you should receive an email notification with the subject "New form submission".

That's it! You now have a system in place that will automatically store responses from your Google Form in a Google Sheet and send you a notification email for every new form submission.

The code I provided is a basic example of how you can write a script to receive data from a Google Form, store it in a Google Sheet, and send an email notification for every new form submission. However, it is just a template and it may need to be modified to fit your specific needs. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the code I provided:

css
Copy code
function onSubmit(e) {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var row = sheet.getLastRow();
  var name = e.values[1];
  var email = e.values[2];
  var message = e.values[3];
  sheet.getRange(row, 1).setValue(name);
  sheet.getRange(row, 2).setValue(email);
  sheet.getRange(row, 3).setValue(message);
  var subject = "New form submission";
  var body = "A new form submission has been received.";
  MailApp.sendEmail("your.email@example.com", subject, body);
}
Here's a breakdown of what each line of code does:

function onSubmit(e) defines a function that will be called when the form is submitted.
var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet(); gets the active sheet in the spreadsheet where the script is running.
var row = sheet.getLastRow(); gets the last row in the sheet where data is added.
var name = e.values[1]; var email = e.values[2]; var message = e.values[3]; gets the values from the form submission event object for each form question and stores them in variables.
sheet.getRange(row, 1).setValue(name); sheet.getRange(row, 2).setValue(email); sheet.getRange(row, 3).setValue(message); sets the values of the name, email, and message variables in the last row of the sheet.
var subject = "New form submission"; var body = "A new form submission has been received."; creates variables for the email subject and body.
MailApp.sendEmail("your.email@example.com", subject, body); sends an email to the specified email address with the subject and body variables.
You will need to modify the code to match the specific questions and column names in your form, as well as the email address you want to send notifications to.




write a code in google apps script such that all the data in the google sheets is received from google forms and then store it into google sheets and for each entry a mail is sent on my gmail account.
Sure, here's an example code snippet that retrieves the responses from a Google Form and stores them in a Google Sheet, while also sending an email notification for each form submission:

css
Copy code
function onSubmit(e) {
  // get form response data
  var response = e.response;
  var itemResponses = response.getItemResponses();
  
  // get sheet where we want to store the data
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  
  // build array of data to be added to sheet
  var row = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < itemResponses.length; i++) {
    row.push(itemResponses[i].getResponse());
  }
  
  // add data to sheet
  sheet.appendRow(row);
  
  // send email notification
  var recipient = "your.email@example.com"; // change this to your email address
  var subject = "New Form Submission";
  var body = "A new form submission has been received.";
  MailApp.sendEmail(recipient, subject, body);
}
