As AI continues to grow and evolve, the limitations of traditional databases become more apparent as the amount of complex, unstructured data is growing rapidly. Vector databases have emerged as a new breed of databases designed specifically to handle these demands.

Vectors are arrays of numbers that can represent complex objects such as words, sentences, images, or audio files in a high-dimensional space called an embedding. These embeddings map the semantic meaning of words and similar features in other types of data. Once you have these embeddings, the challenge becomes how to store them and query them quickly. Vector databases provide an answer to this challenge by storing arrays of numbers clustered together based on similarity, which can be queried with ultra-low latency, making them an ideal choice for AI-driven applications.

Native vector databases, such as Pinecone, Weaviate, QDrant, and Milvus, are emerging and receiving funding from venture capitalists like Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures. Vectors themselves are valuable, as they represent richer datasets ranging from text, audio, images, and videos, making them perfect for use cases in generative AI. While traditional databases such as Postgres and Redis have tools to support vector functionality, they are not as optimized for AI-driven applications.

Vector databases have several use cases, including search engines, automated Q&A, ranking and recommendation engines, classification, deep personalization, low-latency edge AI applications, and similarity search for unstructured data. Furthermore, vector databases facilitate tracking data lineage, which is essential for users to trust model output. Users can track the movement of data from the source system through different forms of persistence and transformations.

	â—¦	Vector search and vector databases are not the only new systems used for long-term memory in large language models (LLMs). Recurrent Memory Transformer is another technique that can scale LLMs to 1M tokens and beyond while maintaining high memory retrieval accuracy without using vector databases. However, solving computational challenges at scale is an ongoing area of development. It will be interesting to see how these techniques develop over time.
