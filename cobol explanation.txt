Here are the steps to sort and generate a policy report in COBOL:

Initialize DB2 connection
CALL 'DB2-INIT'

Fetch policy data from DB2
CALL 'FETCH-POLICY-DATA'
Using PolicyDB2File and WS-Sort-Buffer

Sort policy data in memory
CALL 'SORT-POLICY-DATA'
Using WS-Sort-Buffer

Calculate premium totals
CALL 'CALCULATE-PREMIUM'
Using Total-Premium-Amount

Generate the report
CALL 'GENERATE-REPORT'
Using PolicyReportRecord and PolicySummaryReport

Write the report to a file
CALL 'WRITE-REPORT'
Using PolicyIMSFile and PolicyIMSRecord

Close DB2 connection
CALL 'DB2-CLOSE'

Stop the program
STOP RUN

The key programs are:

FETCH-POLICY-DATA: Gets data from DB2
SORT-POLICY-DATA: Sorts the data in memory
CALCULATE-PREMIUM: Calculates totals
GENERATE-REPORT: Populates report records
WRITE-REPORT: Writes report to file
DB2-INIT and DB2-CLOSE handle the DB2 connection initialization and closure.
